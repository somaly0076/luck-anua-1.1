                        <p>We apologize for the confusion and inconvenience caused to you.</p>

                            <p>Paypal has a unique payment system called the "pre-authorization". When a customer places<br> an order, paypal goes through a review of the payment to verify whether or not they can<br> approve it. In this process, they charge the customer for the same amount, but actually this is<br> just a temporary charge which will be pending during the review process. The second charge<br> will be refunded as soon as the first payment has been approved.</p>
                            
                            <p>We are sorry to tell you that this is not a feature that we can control. We would truly appreciate<br> it if you could wait a few hours or days for the payment to be approved, as you will get<br> refunded for the pre-authorized payment soon.</p>
                            
                            <p>Please let us know if you do not get refunded for the second charge within a month.</p>
